    "description": "Released in 1972 on the album 'Talking Book,' 'Superstition' is Stevie Wonder's hardest-hitting funk single and one of the most influential keyboard performances ever recorded. Wonder played every instrument, but the track's identity lives in the Hohner D6 Clavinet riff — a hammered-string keyboard that produces a sharp, percussive, wah-inflected tone impossible to replicate on a standard piano. The groove is built on 16th-note patterns in Eb minor pentatonic (Eb-Gb-Ab-Bb-Db), with the left hand locking into a chromatic bass figure and the right hand playing staccato chord stabs on syncopated offbeats. Unlike blues (which drags) or jazz (which swings), funk subdivides time into relentless 16th notes where the PLACEMENT of each note within the sixteenth-note grid determines the feel. A note that lands on the 'e' of beat 2 feels completely different from one on the 'and' — this micro-timing is what makes funk groove. For vocalists, Stevie's performance demonstrates another dimension: rhythmic precision married to raw emotion. The vocal line weaves between the instrumental riff, sometimes doubling the keyboard rhythm, sometimes playing against it. Learning to sing WITH a funky keyboard part — not behind it, not on top of it, but interlocked — is what this piece teaches.",
    "structure": "Intro (4 bars): the clavinet riff alone, establishing the Eb minor pentatonic groove — this riff IS the song, and everything else is built around and between its attacks. Verse 1 (16 bars): the vocal enters, weaving a syncopated melody through the riff's rhythmic gaps. The harmony stays on the Ebm tonic pedal — there is essentially one chord for the entire verse, with all motion coming from rhythm and melody. Chorus (8 bars): 'When you believe in things that you don't understand' — the melody ascends and the groove intensifies, though the harmonic palette remains Ebm-based with brief Bb7 tension. Verse 2 (16 bars). Chorus 2. Bridge (8 bars): a brief departure featuring a syncopated horn-line figure and the song's only real harmonic motion away from Ebm. Verse 3. Final Chorus and Outro (vamp and fade on the riff).",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1–4, the clavinet riff entrance: one of the most recognizable keyboard riffs in all of popular music. It is built entirely from the Eb minor pentatonic scale (Eb-Gb-Ab-Bb-Db) with chromatic passing tones, played with aggressive, percussive attack. This riff teaches that a keyboard can function as a rhythm instrument, not just a harmonic one.",
      "The 16th-note grid throughout: every note in the riff is placed with surgical precision within the 16th-note subdivision. Notes on the downbeat feel heavy; notes on the 'e' (second 16th) feel pushing; notes on the 'and' feel floating; notes on the 'a' (fourth 16th) feel pulling. Mastering these four micro-positions is the gateway to all funk and R&B keyboard playing.",
      "The verse vocal entry: Stevie's voice enters in the gaps between riff hits, creating a call-and-response between his voice and his own keyboard. The vocal rhythm is itself syncopated, so you have syncopation against syncopation — two independent rhythmic streams interlocking like gears.",
      "The chorus lift on 'Superstition ain't the way': the melody rises to its highest point and the rhythm simplifies slightly, creating an opening, an exhale, after the verse's rhythmic density. This contrast teaches that groove music needs moments of relative simplicity to make the complexity register.",
      "The single-chord harmonic approach: the entire song is essentially in Eb minor with minimal chord movement. This demonstrates that harmony is not required for musical interest — rhythm, timbre, and melody can carry a song entirely on their own."

    "teachingGoals": [
      "Funk 16th-note rhythm patterns: learning to subdivide each beat into four equal parts and place notes at specific positions within that grid. This is the foundational skill for all funk, R&B, hip-hop, and modern pop keyboard playing.",
      "Percussive keyboard technique: playing with short, sharp attacks (staccato) and muted ghost notes. In funk, the keyboard is a drum — notes are 'hit' rather than 'pressed,' and the release is as important as the attack.",
      "Minor pentatonic riff construction: the Eb minor pentatonic scale (Eb-Gb-Ab-Bb-Db) is the raw material for the riff. Learning to construct catchy, rhythmically interesting patterns from just 5 notes teaches economy — the best riffs use the fewest notes.",
      "Rhythmic independence between voice and keyboard: the vocal line and the keyboard riff have different rhythmic patterns that interlock. Practicing this independence is essential for any performer who plays and sings simultaneously.",
      "Bass-line awareness: the left hand plays a specific chromatic bass figure that anchors the groove. In funk, the bass line is not an afterthought — it is half the rhythm section. Learning to lock the left hand into a pattern while the right hand plays syncopated stabs is the core funk piano coordination."

    "styleTips": [
      "Play it percussively — short, sharp, and dry. No sustain pedal, no held notes, no legato. Every note should pop like a snare drum hit. If it sounds like classical piano, you're doing it wrong.",
      "The groove is everything. Before worrying about notes, get the RHYTHM right. Practice the rhythm on a single note or muted keys until the 16th-note feel is locked in your body. Your foot should be tapping, your head should be nodding — the groove must be physical.",
      "Ghost notes (very quiet, almost-muted key presses) fill the 16th-note grid between the accented notes. These ghost notes are what makes funk feel like a continuous stream rather than isolated hits. They're barely audible but absolutely essential.",
      "The dynamic range is narrow but the dynamic CONTRAST is extreme: accented notes are sharp and loud (mf), ghost notes are nearly silent (ppp). This extreme accent pattern within a narrow overall range is the funk dynamic signature.",
      "For singing Superstition: Stevie's vocal is nasal, bright, and placed high in the mask (resonating in the forehead and nose). The rhythm is clipped — consonants are hard, vowels are short, and every syllable has a precise rhythmic placement. Think of the voice as another percussion instrument. Don't float over the groove — lock INTO it."
