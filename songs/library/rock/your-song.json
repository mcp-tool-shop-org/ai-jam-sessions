    "description": "Written in 1970 on the rooftop of 20 Denmark Street, London, by a 22-year-old Reginald Dwight (Elton John) with lyrics by the 19-year-old Bernie Taupin, 'Your Song' is the piece that proved piano could be a rock instrument. Before Elton, rock piano was an afterthought — a honky-tonk supplement to guitars. 'Your Song' placed the piano at the center, with the vocal and keyboard creating a complete performance that needed nothing else. The key of Eb major is significant: it sits in the warm, rich middle register of the piano, and it's a comfortable key for a male baritone voice. The chord progression uses inversions extensively — the bass line descends smoothly (Eb-D-C-Bb) while the chord qualities change above it, creating the illusion of harmonic motion even though individual chords share common tones. This technique, called 'bass-line voice leading,' is Elton's signature and the reason his accompaniments sound so fluid. For vocalists, this is a masterclass in conversational singing: the melody follows the natural speech rhythm of Taupin's slightly awkward, heartfelt lyrics ('It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside'), and the emotional power comes from sincerity, not from range or dynamic extremes.",
    "structure": "Intro (4 bars): the piano establishes the Eb-Bb/D-Cm-Cm/Bb pattern — a descending bass line under arpeggiated chords that creates immediate forward motion. Verse 1 (8 bars, 'It's a little bit funny'): the vocal melody stays in the mid-range, conversational and intimate, over alternating Eb and Ab-based harmonies. Verse 2 (8 bars, 'If I was a sculptor'): same musical structure but the melody begins exploring higher notes — the first sign of emotional opening. Chorus (8 bars, 'I hope you don't mind'): the melody reaches its highest point (Bb above middle C), the dynamic lifts to mf, and the chord progression opens to include Fm7 and Ab/Bb — the song's emotional climax. Verse 3 (8 bars, 'I sat on the roof'): return to the intimate mid-range. Verse 4 (8 bars, 'So excuse me forgetting'): building again. Final Chorus: the emotional peak returns with slightly more intensity, the piano now playing fuller chords. Outro: the intro pattern returns, fading or resolving on Eb.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1–4, the descending bass-line intro (Eb-D-C-Bb): this four-note descent under shifting chords is Elton John's most recognizable gesture and the template for a hundred piano ballads that followed. It teaches that a stepwise bass line creates inevitable forward motion — the listener is pulled through the progression.",
      "Verse 1, 'It's a little bit funny': the melody is barely above speaking pitch, and the phrasing mirrors natural speech. The word 'funny' falls on a weak beat, exactly where you'd stress it in conversation. This is where many singers fail — they try to 'sing' it instead of 'saying' it.",
      "The Cm shift at 'If I was a sculptor': the minor chord creates the first moment of emotional complexity. The Eb major warmth suddenly has a shadow, and Taupin's lyric matches perfectly — he's admitting inadequacy. This teaches how harmony and text can reinforce each other.",
      "The chorus on 'I hope you don't mind': the melody rises to its peak on 'mind,' the dynamic opens up, and the progression introduces Fm7 for the first time — a chord with genuine ache in it. The chorus doesn't shout; it glows. This teaches that emotional peaks can be warm rather than loud.",
      "The Bb/Ab voicing under 'How wonderful life is': the specific chord inversion Elton uses here — a Bb chord with Ab in the bass creating an unresolved dominant feeling — suspends the emotion before the final resolution to Eb. This suspension before resolution is the most powerful cadential gesture in pop music."

    "teachingGoals": [
      "Pop/rock piano ballad accompaniment: arpeggiated or broken-chord patterns in the right hand over bass notes or octaves in the left. This texturally rich but technically simple approach is the foundation of all piano-driven pop-rock.",
      "Chord inversions for smooth voice leading: instead of jumping between root-position chords, using inversions to create a smooth, stepwise bass line (Eb-D-C-Bb). This is the single most important arrangement skill for piano — it's what separates amateur chord-playing from professional accompaniment.",
      "Building dynamics across verse-chorus structure: each verse should be incrementally louder and more intense than the last, culminating in the chorus. Playing verse 4 exactly like verse 1 is a missed opportunity — the gradual build creates emotional arc without changing any notes.",
      "Piano-vocal independence: keeping the piano accompaniment steady and flowing while the voice moves independently above it. The piano is the ground; the voice is the bird. Neither should be aware of the other's difficulties.",
      "Singing with natural speech rhythm: the melody of 'Your Song' is essentially heightened speech. Learning to let the lyrics dictate the rhythm and phrasing — rather than imposing a musical rhythm on the words — is the essential pop vocal skill."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Keep the left hand steady — simple bass notes or octaves alternating with the root and fifth. The left hand is the anchor. If it wavers, the whole song feels seasick.",
      "The right hand should flow, not plod — connect the arpeggiated chords with finger legato, letting each note melt into the next. Think of pouring honey, not stacking bricks.",
      "Build through each verse: verse 1 is pp (intimate whisper), verse 2 is p (gentle warmth), verse 3 is mp (quiet confidence), chorus is mf (open heart). No single moment is loud, but the journey from whisper to warm is enormous.",
      "The tempo is around 65 BPM for the quarter note — slow enough to breathe between phrases, fast enough to maintain forward momentum. Don't drag, but don't push. Elton's recording has a gentle propulsion, like a bicycle coasting downhill.",
      "For singing: this is a love letter, not a performance. The voice should sound like a young man who can't quite believe what he's feeling — slightly uncertain, slightly amazed, deeply sincere. No vibrato on the verses, a little on the chorus. Let the cracks show. Elton's original vocal is imperfect and that's precisely what makes it perfect."
