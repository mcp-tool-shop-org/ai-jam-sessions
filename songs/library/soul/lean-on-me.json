    "description": "Written in 1972 by Bill Withers on a beat-up Wurlitzer piano in his Los Angeles apartment, inspired by the close-knit community of his childhood in Slab Fork, West Virginia (population: 200). Withers was 34 — a former aircraft mechanic who had installed toilets on 747s before becoming a musician. That plainspoken, working-class authenticity is embedded in every note: the song uses only the white keys of C major (zero sharps, zero flats), the melody is built almost entirely from stepwise motion (no leaps greater than a third), and the chord progression (C-Dm-Em-F-Em-Dm-C, ascending and descending through the diatonic scale) is the simplest possible harmonic path. Yet this song has been performed at inaugurations, funerals, protests, and disaster relief concerts for 50 years because its musical simplicity creates universality — anyone can sing it, anyone can play it, anyone can feel it. The ascending piano riff (C-D-E-F-E-D-C) that opens the song is the piece's DNA: a scale fragment that rises with hope and descends with reassurance. For vocalists, this is the ultimate gospel-derived soul vocal: warm tone, chest voice, communal phrasing. The bridge section's call-and-response ('Call me!') is a direct ancestor of African-American church music — the lead singer calls, the congregation answers. Learning this texture teaches that music can be participatory, not performative.",
    "structure": "Intro (4 bars): the famous ascending piano riff — C-D-E-F-E-D-C played over a simple left-hand bass, unaccompanied. This four-bar figure recurs throughout as a structural anchor. Verse 1 (8 bars, 'Sometimes in our lives'): the vocal melody mirrors the riff's stepwise motion, staying in the comfortable mid-range (C4 to G4). The harmony walks up the C major scale: C-Dm-Em-F, then back down. Chorus (8 bars, 'Lean on me'): the melody ascends to its most emphatic note (G, the dominant) on the title phrase, supported by the strongest cadential chords (F-C-G-C). The feel shifts from introspective to communal. Verse 2 (8 bars, 'Please swallow your pride'). Chorus 2. Bridge (8 bars, 'If there is a load'): the call-and-response section — the lead sings a phrase, the chorus answers 'Call me!' This is the gospel heart of the song, and its energy lifts the final section. Final Chorus and Outro: the piano riff returns underneath the vocal, bringing the piece full circle — the same simplicity that opened it now closes it, but now invested with all the emotion of the journey.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1–4, the ascending piano riff (C-D-E-F-E-D-C): a scale fragment in its purest form — no harmony, no rhythm section, just a single melodic line on the piano. This opening teaches that a great musical idea doesn't need complexity. The symmetry of the ascending-descending shape gives it a sense of completeness, like an arch.",
      "Verse 1 vocal entrance on 'Sometimes in our lives': the voice enters at a pitch barely above normal speaking range, and the phrasing matches conversational English rhythm. Withers doesn't 'perform' — he talks. This teaches that soul singing is heightened speech, not concert-hall technique.",
      "The chorus on 'Lean on me': the title phrase lands on G (the 5th degree), the brightest, most open note in C major. The word 'lean' stretches over two beats, creating the musical equivalent of leaning itself. Text-painting this transparent — where the music literally does what the word says — is a hallmark of great songwriting.",
      "The bridge call-and-response ('Call me / I'll be there'): the most directly gospel-derived moment. The lead voice sings a short phrase, space is left, and the chorus answers. This texture is thousands of years old — it predates written music — and it transforms the song from a performance into a community ritual.",
      "The diatonic chord walk (C-Dm-Em-F-Em-Dm-C): the chords literally walk up and down the white keys, one scale degree at a time. No chord is more than one step from its neighbor. This teaches that the simplest harmonic motion — stepwise — can be the most powerful, because the listener can follow every step."

      "Diatonic melody construction: the entire song uses only the notes of the C major scale (all white keys). This teaches that compelling melody does not require chromaticism, modes, or exotic scales — the seven notes of a major scale contain infinite musical possibilities.",
      "Gospel piano accompaniment: a warm, steady left-hand bass pattern (root-fifth or root-octave) under right-hand chord stabs on beats 2 and 4 (the 'backbeat'). This is the rhythmic spine of gospel, soul, and R&B piano — it feels like clapping in church.",
      "Building from solo piano to full arrangement: the song begins with piano alone, adds voice, adds bass and drums, adds chorus — each element entering naturally. Learning to create this gradual build teaches arrangement thinking, even in a simple piece.",
      "Call-and-response form: one voice sings, others answer. This ancient musical practice is the basis of gospel, blues, jazz, and most African-American musical traditions. Understanding it opens up a fundamental rhythmic and social concept.",
      "Vocal warmth and placement: soul singing requires a warm, chest-register sound with full, open vowels ('LEEN on ME' with long 'ee' and full 'ee'). The voice should feel like it's coming from the solar plexus, not the throat. This grounded, body-resonant placement is the opposite of head-voice singing and the foundation of all R&B and gospel vocal technique."

    "styleTips": [
      "Play the opening riff cleanly and evenly — it should feel like walking at a steady pace. Each note is the same duration, same volume, same weight. The simplicity IS the beauty. If you add syncopation or emphasis, you're fighting the song.",
      "The left hand provides a gentle, rocking bass pattern — think of a porch swing, not a drum. Root on beat 1, a lower neighbor or fifth on beat 3, with a gentle walking quality. Gospel bass is felt more than heard.",
      "Build the gospel feel gradually: verse 1 is intimate (just piano and voice), chorus 1 adds warmth, verse 2 adds subtle intensity, and the bridge explodes into communal joy. Don't start at the emotional destination — let the song take you there.",
      "On the bridge call-and-response: leave real space between the call and the response. Don't rush to fill the gap. The silence IS the invitation for others to join. Gospel music breathes — it makes room for the congregation.",
      "For singing: this is a baritone song, meant to be sung in a warm, open chest voice. No falsetto, no head voice, no vocal acrobatics. Sing it like you're speaking to a friend who's hurting. Make the vowels round and full, make the consonants gentle, and let the words carry the emotion. Bill Withers never showed off — he showed up."
