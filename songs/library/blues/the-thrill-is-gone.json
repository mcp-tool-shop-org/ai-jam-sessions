    "description": "Roy Hawkins wrote 'The Thrill Is Gone' in 1951, but it was B.B. King's 1969 recording — with its revolutionary addition of orchestral strings over a minor blues — that turned it into the single most important modern blues performance. The move from standard major-key 12-bar blues to a minor tonality (Bm) was radical: it replaced the usual swaggering bravado with resignation and hurt. The vocal delivery is conversational, almost defeated, with King's guitar answering each sung phrase in a call-and-response that dates back to field hollers. As a piano vehicle, this song teaches the art of comping behind a vocalist — providing the harmonic bed while leaving vast space for the voice and lead instrument to breathe.",
    "structure": "12-bar minor blues, repeating for each verse. Bars 1–4: Bm7 (i) — tonic pedal, establishing the ache. Bars 5–6: Em7 (iv) — the subdominant deepening. Bars 7–8: Bm7 (i) — return. Bars 9–10: F#7 (V) to Em7 (iv) — the turnaround tension. Bars 11–12: Bm7 (i) to F#7 (V) — cadential turnaround leading back to the top. The form is deceptively simple; the emotional arc comes from dynamics, vocal phrasing, and what happens *between* the chords.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1–4, the Bm7 vamp opening: the single chord establishing mood before any melody arrives — this teaches that groove and feel can say more than harmony",
      "Bars 5–6, the Em7 (iv chord): the first harmonic motion, felt as an emotional deepening — the vocal line typically rises here against the descending bass",
      "Bars 9–10, the F#7-Em7 turnaround: the moment of maximum tension, where dominant wants to resolve but passes through iv first — unique to minor blues",
      "The vocal call-and-guitar-response gaps: every sung phrase ends with 1–2 bars of silence filled by instrumental response — the piano must *not* fill these gaps",
      "The string entrance (in the original recording): when the arrangement swells from sparse trio to orchestral fullness — a lesson in building intensity over multiple choruses"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Minor blues form vs. major 12-bar blues — understanding why i-iv-V in minor sounds fundamentally different from I-IV-V in major",
      "Blues comping: rhythmic chord stabs on beats 2 and 4 (the backbeat), with the left hand walking a sparse bass line on 1 and 3",
      "Call-and-response phrasing — learning when NOT to play is as important as what to play; the piano must breathe with the vocalist",
      "Minor pentatonic scale (B-D-E-F#-A) for fills: the five notes that define the blues vocabulary in this key",
      "Dynamic arc over a repeating form — each 12-bar chorus should build slightly, so the fifth chorus hits harder than the first without changing a single note"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Play behind the beat — not late, but *leaning back*. Blues time is relaxed, almost lazy. If you feel like you're rushing, you definitely are.",
      "Less is more: B.B. King famously said 'one note can say more than a thousand.' Apply this to piano — a single well-placed chord with space around it beats a flurry of notes.",
      "Use tremolo (rapidly alternating) chords in the right hand during climactic moments to create the shimmering tension King's band used.",
      "The left hand should outline roots and fifths, not full chords — give the harmony room to breathe. Think upright bass, not pipe organ.",
      "When singing, the vocal should be conversational and slightly behind the beat too — the words should feel like they're being *confessed*, not performed. Drop the jaw, darken the vowels, and let phrases trail off."
