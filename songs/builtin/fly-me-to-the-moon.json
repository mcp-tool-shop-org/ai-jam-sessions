    "description": "Written in 1954 as 'In Other Words', this became a jazz standard after Frank Sinatra's 1964 recording with Count Basie. The melody walks down the scale in a way that feels inevitable — each phrase landing on a chord tone that pulls you into the next change. It's a circle-of-fifths masterclass disguised as a love song.",
    "structure": "AABA form condensed into 16 bars. The A sections walk through the circle of fifths (Am-Dm-G-C), and the B section lifts to the IV chord before cycling back. Every phrase descends, giving the melody its characteristic graceful falling motion.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-4: The opening descent Am7-Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 — a textbook ii-V-I preceded by vi. The melody falls stepwise through each chord.",
      "Measures 5-8: Fmaj7-Bm7b5-E7-Am — the bridge lifts to IV, then the classic jazz iii-VI-ii turnaround. E7 to Am is the emotional pivot.",
      "Measures 9-12: Second A — same changes, the melody varies slightly. Familiarity breeds comfort.",
      "Measures 13-16: The final turnaround. Dm7-G7 resolving to C — home. The melody settles on the tonic with finality."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Circle-of-fifths motion: Am-Dm-G-C (vi-ii-V-I). This is THE jazz progression. Once you hear it, you'll hear it everywhere.",
      "Left hand shell voicings: root + 7th (or root + 3rd). These two-note voicings are the foundation of jazz piano comping.",
      "Smooth melodic descent: the right hand moves mostly by step and small skip. Follow the line, don't jump.",
      "The ii-V-I cadence (Dm7-G7-Cmaj7) — the most important progression in jazz. Practice this in all 12 keys.",
      "Bm7b5 (half-diminished) — the diatonic iii chord in minor keys, functioning as ii in the key of Am. A beautiful, tense sound."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Swing the eighth notes slightly — not dotted, just a gentle lean. Jazz lives in the space between straight and dotted.",
      "Left hand should be quiet and steady. Think of it as a bassist walking underneath.",
      "The melody should sing. Play legato, connect the notes. Imagine a vocalist phrasing each line.",
      "Don't rush through the chord changes — let each one breathe. The beauty is in how they connect.",
      "Dynamics: start mf, pull back to mp in the bridge, build back for the final resolution."
