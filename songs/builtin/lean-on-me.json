    "description": "Bill Withers wrote this in 1972, inspired by the community spirit of his West Virginia hometown. The genius is in the simplicity — a gospel-influenced melody built entirely on the C major scale, harmonized with the most basic chords in music. No tricks, no cleverness, just truth. The piano part is central — Withers played it himself on the recording.",
    "structure": "16 bars covering the verse and chorus. The verse (measures 1-8) establishes the gentle, reassuring theme over a I-ii-iii-IV-V progression. The chorus (measures 9-16) lifts with call-and-response energy. The whole thing walks up and down the C major scale like a hymn.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: The opening piano figure — C-D-E-F-G ascending up the scale. This IS the song. Every human on earth knows this melody.",
      "Measures 3-4: The melody descends G-F-E-D-C. What goes up must come down. The symmetry is the beauty.",
      "Measures 9-10: Chorus — 'Lean on me.' The melody simplifies to repeated notes with gospel emphasis. The energy lifts.",
      "Measures 13-14: The emotional peak — melody reaches up to G5 with the strongest dynamics. Community, unity, strength."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "The C major scale IS the melody. This song proves that the simplest material can be the most powerful.",
      "Basic chord progression: C-Dm-Em-F-G (I-ii-iii-IV-V). Walking up the scale in chords.",
      "Gospel piano feel: left hand plays steady roots and fifths, right hand plays the melody with occasional chord fills.",
      "Playing with conviction: this song requires emotional commitment, not technical skill. Mean every note.",
      "The ascending/descending scale pattern — what goes up comes down. The melody mirrors the message: we carry each other."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Play this like you're in church. Steady, grounded, soulful. The groove is slow and deliberate.",
      "Left hand should be rock-solid. Root-fifth, on the beat, every time. This is the foundation that everyone leans on.",
      "The melody should be played with weight — not heavy, but present. Each note matters.",
      "Don't add complexity. The power is in the simplicity. Resist the urge to embellish.",
      "Slight swing feel — not jazz swing, more of a gospel lilt. The eighth notes lean, they don't rush."
