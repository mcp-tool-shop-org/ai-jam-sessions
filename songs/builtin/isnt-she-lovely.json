    "description": "Stevie Wonder wrote this for his newborn daughter Aisha in 1976. The melody is built on a simple diatonic pattern over a chromatic harmonic bassline — the kind of thing that sounds effortless but is harmonically sophisticated. The harmonica intro is iconic, but on piano the melody sings just as sweetly. The groove is everything.",
    "structure": "Verse form — two 8-bar passes through the main progression. The first pass states the melody simply, the second adds rhythmic variation and a wider melodic arc. No chorus per se — the verse IS the hook.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: E major to G#m — the tonic to the relative minor feeling. The melody lands on G#, establishing the vocal range.",
      "Measures 3-4: C#m7 to B7 — the vi to V. Classic R&B turnaround. The melody descends stepwise.",
      "Measures 5-6: A to Am — the IV to iv. The minor IV is the emotional heart — that bittersweet Stevie move.",
      "Measures 7-8: E/B to B7 — resolution over a bass pedal. The melody floats home.",
      "Measure 13: Am chord — the emotional peak of the second pass. Minor IV with the melody at its highest."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "The major-to-minor-IV progression (A to Am) — one of the most powerful moves in pop and R&B. The single chromatic note (C# going to C natural) changes everything.",
      "Left hand shell voicings with a walking bass feel — root movement drives the harmony forward.",
      "Syncopation: the melody sits slightly behind the beat. Don't rush. Let the groove breathe.",
      "Smooth voice leading: the right hand moves in small intervals, connecting chord tones across changes.",
      "The chromatic bass descent (E-D#-C#-B) gives the progression its forward motion."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "This is a feel song. The groove matters more than the notes. Play it relaxed, slightly behind the beat.",
      "Keep the left hand steady and grounded — it's the heartbeat. The right hand floats on top.",
      "The Am chord (measure 5) should feel like a sigh. Don't hit it hard — let the minor color speak.",
      "Dynamics should be gentle throughout — this is a lullaby at heart. Even the loud moments are warm.",
      "Listen to Stevie's harmonica phrasing — that's what the right hand melody should feel like. Vocal, not mechanical."
