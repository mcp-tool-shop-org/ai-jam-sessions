    "description": "Written in 1940 by a 16-year-old Mexican pianist, this became one of the most recorded songs in history. The melody lives in D minor — passionate, yearning, built on a descending bass line that gives the bolero its characteristic gravity. The harmonic language blends classical voice leading with Latin rhythm.",
    "structure": "Two 8-bar sections. The first states the main melody over a descending bass (Dm-Dm/C-Bb-A7). The second intensifies with wider intervals and a dramatic climb before resolving. The bolero rhythm — slow, deliberate, full of breath — is everything.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: Dm to Dm/C — the tonic with a descending bass. The melody enters on D and rises. The chromatic bass descent creates forward motion without changing the chord quality.",
      "Measures 3-4: Bbmaj7 to A7 — the bVI to V. The Bb chord is warm and open; A7 pulls back to minor with urgency.",
      "Measures 5-8: Gm to A7 to Dm — the iv-V-i cadence. The emotional core. Gm adds weight, A7 creates tension, Dm resolves with bittersweet warmth.",
      "Measures 13-14: The melody reaches its peak on Bb5 — the highest, most passionate moment. Let it sing."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Minor key expression: D minor has a natural melancholy that the melody exploits beautifully.",
      "Descending bass lines: Dm-C-Bb-A creates motion while the chord quality shifts above. This is a Baroque technique that Latin music inherited.",
      "The iv-V-i cadence in minor: Gm-A7-Dm. The raised 3rd in A7 (C#) is what makes minor keys dramatic.",
      "Bolero rhythm: slow, spacious, every note placed with intention. Don't fill the space — let it breathe.",
      "Expressive dynamics: this song demands rubato and dynamic shaping. Play from the heart."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "This is a bolero — slow, passionate, deliberate. Every note should feel like it means something.",
      "The left hand bass line should walk smoothly. Think of a bass guitar in a Latin ensemble — steady, grounded, melodic.",
      "Let the melody sing above everything. It should feel like a voice, not a piano.",
      "Use slight rubato on the longer notes — stretch time at emotional peaks, pull back on resolution.",
      "The A7 chord should feel like longing. The C# (raised 7th) is the dissonance that makes minor keys ache."
