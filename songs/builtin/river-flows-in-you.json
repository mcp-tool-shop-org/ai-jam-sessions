    "description": "Yiruma's 2001 piece became one of the most-played piano works of the 21st century. It lives in A major but constantly touches the relative F# minor, creating a gentle oscillation between warmth and wistfulness. The melody is built on arpeggiated patterns that flow like water — hence the name. Simple harmonies, profound effect.",
    "structure": "16 bars: an 8-bar A section with the flowing arpeggiated melody, then an 8-bar B section that adds harmonic depth and a wider melodic range. The piece is meant to loop and repeat, each pass gaining subtle intensity.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: A major arpeggiation — the 'river' pattern. Right hand flows A-C#-E in broken patterns while left hand provides the foundation.",
      "Measures 3-4: F#m — the relative minor. The mood shifts subtly. Same flowing motion, different emotional color.",
      "Measures 7-8: D to E — the IV-V, the classic setup for return. The melody rises to its first section peak.",
      "Measures 13-14: The B section climax. F#m with the melody at its highest and most expressive point.",
      "Measure 16: Return to A — the river completes its cycle."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Arpeggiated melody patterns: the right hand breaks chords into flowing lines. This is the piece's core technique.",
      "Pedaling: this piece demands good pedal technique. Change the sustain pedal with each chord change to avoid muddiness.",
      "The I-vi relationship: A major and F# minor share all the same notes. The shift between them is subtle but emotional.",
      "Left hand broken chord patterns: steady, even, flowing. The left hand IS the river; the right hand is what flows on it.",
      "Dynamic shaping over long phrases: build and release over 4-8 bar arcs, not note by note."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Everything flows. No sharp attacks, no sudden stops. Imagine water — continuous, smooth, inevitable.",
      "Pedal is essential. Hold the sustain pedal through each chord, release and re-press exactly on the chord change.",
      "The tempo should breathe — slightly slower at phrase endings, slightly forward at phrase beginnings. Not mechanical.",
      "Keep the left hand quieter than the right. It's the current underneath; the melody floats on top.",
      "Play this piece from memory if you can. It's about feeling, not reading. Close your eyes and let it flow."
